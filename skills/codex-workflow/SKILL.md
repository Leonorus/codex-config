# Codex Workflow

This is the Codex port of the Claude `classify-task` workflow. It is the source of truth for task buckets in Codex. Apply only the amount of process the task deserves.

## Start-of-task Rule

Workflow: for substantial software/ops/debug/research/repo-maintenance, call mcp_workflow_start_task(prompt,cwd,repo) first; state/override bucket, load returned skills, follow contract/context/delegation/finish checklist. Use Workflow/Obsidian MCP before Obsidian claims. Finish non-trivia with mcp_workflow_finish_checklist. Fallback: codex-workflow.

In Codex runtimes that expose Workflow MCP, treat that line as the first-move rule before planning, proposing an approach, or editing files. Pass the prompt plus `cwd`, `repo`, and `session_id` when known. Treat the returned packet as a structured checklist rather than unquestionable authority; override it when user correction or gathered evidence shows the bucket is wrong.

This skill remains the canonical human-readable policy. If Workflow MCP is unavailable, fails, stale, not exposed in Codex, or produces an obviously wrong classification, use this skill directly and state one visible sentence:

`Bucket: <bucket> — <why>; applying <matching workflow weight>.`

Skip this only for casual chat, simple factual answers, or clear follow-ups to an already-classified task.

## Classify First

For non-trivia work, state the bucket in one short sentence and run that flow:

| Bucket | Signals | Flow |
|---|---|---|
| Trivia | Typo, one-line obvious doc/config fix, mechanical rename | Just do it. No plan, no architecture review, no note. |
| Light Ops | Single-file Ansible/Terraform/k8s/CI/Docker, small diff, no prod boundary, no new role/module/stack | Inspect convention -> edit surgically -> run targeted lint/fmt/check -> summarize. |
| Heavy Ops | Multi-file ops, prod boundary, secrets/network/security, new role/module/stack, architectural shift, repeated pattern | Think before coding -> consult `codex-knowledge` -> plan -> implement -> lint/validate -> dry-run gate before apply -> review -> docs/note. |
| App Code | `go.mod`/`pyproject.toml`, tests present, multiple modules/packages | Define success -> add or run failing test first -> implement -> targeted tests -> review -> docs. |
| Script | Single-file Go/Python glue, run-once or cron, no app test harness | Short plan if non-trivial -> implement minimal script -> smoke-test safe input -> docs if reusable. |
| Debug | Bug report, failing test, stack trace, unexpected behavior | Reproduce -> hypothesize -> instrument/read -> fix the cause -> verify the exact failure is gone -> note findings if concrete. |
| Research | "How does X work", compare options, repo exploration, no code change | Read and report. Use Obsidian when this is Ops/Infra, Debug, architecture, or reusable research. |
| Repo-maintenance | Dependency bumps, CI cleanup, docs cleanup, tests, release metadata, repository hygiene, stale config, or convention maintenance | Inspect current convention -> split independent areas such as CI/deps/docs/tests/release -> use subagents where useful -> edit surgically -> run affected validation -> update docs/notes when conventions change. |
| Ambiguous | Multiple buckets fit or scope is unclear | Ask a concise clarifying question before edits. |

Escalate Light Ops to Heavy Ops if the diff grows beyond roughly 50 lines, spreads across files, touches prod/secrets/network, reveals a deeper design issue, or repeats across multiple repos.

## Bucket Contracts

Use these contracts after classification. They keep global agent instructions short while making each bucket's first move, context requirement, delegation posture, and finish condition explicit.

| Bucket | First move | Context / skills | Delegation default | Verification and finish |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trivia | Do the tiny change or answer directly. | No Obsidian, plan, or companion skill. | Never delegate. | Cheap check only if a file/command changed; no note. |
| Light Ops | Inspect nearby convention before editing. | Use repo-native lint/fmt/schema checks; no Obsidian unless design risk appears. | Usually direct; optionally one cheap reviewer/validator child. | Targeted lint/fmt/check, summarize. Escalate if scope or risk grows. |
| Heavy Ops | Name blast radius, assumptions, rollback/dry-run path. | Consult `codex-knowledge` / Obsidian before proposing approach; use sequential thinking when risk/tradeoffs are high. | Parallelize read-only discovery, risk review, and validation-plan review; parent keeps destructive actions. | Lint/validate/render/dry-run/smoke as applicable; docs and raw Obsidian note for concrete findings/fixes. |
| App Code | Define success criteria and existing test shape. | Inspect project conventions; use TDD/review skills when behavior changes or tests exist. | Use implementer/reviewer subagents for independent modules only. | Targeted tests first, broader checks as needed; update docs if API/workflow changed. |
| Script | Define input/output/exit-code, idempotency, and side effects. | Inspect runtime/schedule conventions; keep implementation minimal. | One implementer or reviewer for non-trivial scripts; avoid competing edits to same file. | Syntax check plus safe smoke test; for cron/launchd, verify schedule, locking/state, and logs. |
| Debug | Reproduce or observe the exact failure before fixing. | Consult Obsidian for prior incidents/patterns; use systematic debugging for unclear root cause. | Spawn an independent investigator when bug is unclear: repro/logs vs code-path/config. | Verify the exact failure is gone; note concrete root cause/fix unless duplicate/trivial. |
| Research | State the question, decision needed, and evidence bar. | Use Obsidian for Ops/Infra, Debug, architecture, or reusable research; use upstream docs/source when relevant. | Use 2-3 researchers when scope permits: upstream, local, Obsidian/org alternatives. | Report facts, assumptions, recommendation, confidence, risks, and next checks; no code changes. |
| Repo-maintenance | Check git status/diff and preserve unrelated user changes. | Inspect affected areas: CI, deps, docs, tests, release metadata, config conventions. | Split independent inspectors where useful. | Run affected checks, report unrelated findings separately, update docs/notes if conventions change. |
| Ambiguous | Ask one concise clarifying question, or proceed with an explicit low-risk assumption. | Do not load extra workflow beyond what is needed to clarify. | Do not delegate into unclear requirements. | No edits until scope is safe; reclassify after clarification. |

## Subagent Acceleration Policy

For substantial buckets, default to using available subagent or parallel-agent mechanisms when independent inspection, research, implementation, debugging-hypothesis, or review streams exist. This is a strong default, not blind fan-out: before doing substantial work directly, either spawn useful independent agents or state why delegation would slow the task down (single serial change, no independent workstream, tiny diff, destructive/interactive step, or missing context that only the parent has).

Bucket-specific defaults:

| Bucket | Subagent default |
|---|---|
| Trivia | No delegation. Do the tiny change directly. |
| Light Ops | Usually direct; consider one independent reviewer/validator when cheap. |
| Script | For non-trivial scripts, use one implementer or one reviewer; avoid competing edits to the same file. |
| Research | Use 2-3 parallel researchers when scope permits: upstream docs/source, local repo/context, and prior Obsidian/organization knowledge. |
| App Code | Prefer subagent-driven implementation plus spec/quality review when tasks touch independent modules. |
| Debug | Use at least one independent investigator for unclear bugs: repro/logs vs code-path/config inspection. |
| Heavy Ops | Parallelize read-only discovery, risk review, and validation-plan review; keep destructive actions in the parent session. |
| Repo-maintenance | Split CI, dependencies, docs, tests, and release metadata inspection where useful. |
| Ambiguous | Clarify first; do not spawn children into unclear requirements. |

If the current Codex runtime does not expose a subagent tool, state that briefly and parallelize only with available safe read/search/terminal operations. Extra tokens, context gathering, and independent agent passes are acceptable when they materially improve correctness, reasoning quality, speed to a verified result, or failure-rate reduction; do not under-spec context just to save tokens.

## Reasoning Guard Policy

For substantial buckets, prefer evidence-gated reasoning over token thrift. Use sequential thinking or an equivalent explicit reasoning scaffold when any guard trigger is present:

- Heavy Ops touching prod, network, secrets, permissions, data migration, or rollback-sensitive paths.
- Unclear Debug/root-cause work, repeated failed fixes, or bugs with multiple plausible causes.
- Architecture, migration, scaling, or performance decisions where tradeoffs matter.
- Risky app-code refactors, cross-module behavior changes, or user requests for higher confidence.

The reasoning guard should track:

- `mode`: debugging, architecture, performance, ops, research, app-code, or repo-maintenance.
- `evidence`: tool-backed refs such as file paths/line ranges, command output, CI/job IDs, fetched docs, Obsidian note paths, benchmark results, or deployment/dry-run output.
- `alternatives`: at least two options for architecture/Heavy Ops decisions and at least two falsifiable hypotheses for unclear Debug.
- `confidence`: confidence claims above 80 require tool-backed evidence plus a verification plan; otherwise lower the confidence or gather more evidence.
- `budget`: 2-3 thoughts for light analysis, 3-5 for standard debug/research, and 5-8 for high-risk architecture/Heavy Ops. Continue past the budget only when new evidence, a branch, or a contradiction is reducing risk.

Mode-specific stop/go checks:

- Debug: do not fix before reproducing or observing the exact failure and naming at least one falsifiable hypothesis.
- Heavy Ops: do not apply before naming blast radius, rollback/dry-run path, secret/network boundary, and validation.
- Architecture: do not recommend before comparing alternatives, tradeoffs, and the decision rule; emit a compact decision/ADR summary when a choice is made.
- Performance: do not claim improvement without a baseline, target metric, and measurement/benchmark command or a stated reason measurement is impossible.
- Research: distinguish fetched/source-backed facts from assumptions and cite only docs/notes actually read.

Persist only durable outcomes: compact project notes, skills, or memory entries that record decision, evidence, verification, and later outcome. Prefer decision/outcome records over raw thought traces.

## Workflow MCP and Obsidian Context

For Ops/Infra, Debug, architecture choices, and reusable research, use `mcp_workflow_start_task` candidate notes or `mcp_workflow_discover_context` when Workflow MCP is available, then read the directly relevant Obsidian notes before proposing an approach. Without Workflow MCP, consult `codex-knowledge` manually. Candidate paths are routing metadata, not citations; cite only notes actually read.

## Always-On Principles

- Think before coding: name the goal, load-bearing assumptions, unknowns, and tradeoffs before edits.
- Simplicity first: implement only what the current request needs; avoid speculative flags, helpers, abstractions, and "nice to have" extras.
- Surgical changes: touch only required lines plus direct wiring/tests; report unrelated issues instead of fixing them inline.
- Goal-driven execution: define "done" as verifiable criteria, run the smallest relevant check first, and only claim success with command evidence.

## Cross-Cutting Requirements

- For Ops/Infra, Debug, architecture choices, and reusable research, consult `codex-knowledge` before proposing an approach.
- After implementation, update affected project docs and `AGENTS.md` instructions when the change alters workflow, commands, architecture, or conventions.
- For workflow note writes or updates, use Obsidian MCP write tools as the first write surface; avoid shell redirection, heredocs, Python scripts, or raw filesystem edits for vault notes unless Obsidian MCP is unavailable, then state the fallback.
- Heavy Ops and Debug with a shipped fix or concrete findings should write a raw Obsidian note unless duplicate or trivial.
- Other non-trivia buckets should ask whether to take a note, with a one-line summary and target path.
- Use `Projects/<repo>/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` for raw notes.
- After creating or updating a raw project note, run targeted Obsidian discovery against `Projects/<repo>/`, `Knowledge/`, and `Organization/` to decide whether the new finding should be promoted, linked, or left raw.
- Promote to `Knowledge/` when the pattern plausibly applies at 5+ different employers; update the Knowledge page, `Knowledge/index.md`, and `Knowledge/log.md` in the same pass.
- Put internal hostnames, concrete service graphs, ticket IDs, employee names, org codenames, and company-specific runbooks in `Organization/`; update `Organization/index.md`/`log.md` when making synthesis-layer changes there.

## Codex-Specific Adaptation

- Do not copy Claude custom-agent routing literally. Use Codex subagents/parallel agents when the runtime exposes them and they materially improve correctness or latency; otherwise keep orchestration local and use available tools for safe parallel read/search work.
- Do not use or invent Beads, `bd`, `template-bridge`, or mandatory task-tracker commands. Those tools are not currently available.
- Do not use git worktrees unless the user explicitly asks. Work directly in the current checkout.
- Use project-local `AGENTS.md` as the durable instruction surface. If a repo has `CLAUDE.md`, migrate relevant project instructions into `AGENTS.md` when safe.
- For OpenAI/Codex docs, use the `openai-docs` skill and official sources.
- Prefer local tools and project conventions over generic workflow steps.
- Prefer RTK-prefixed shell commands when practical. For complex shell features that RTK cannot parse, use `rtk proxy <cmd>`.

## Review And Finish

Before final response:

- Check `git diff`/`git status` for unintended edits when working in a git repo.
- Run relevant verification: tests, lint, formatter, build, dry-run, syntax check, or smoke check.
- If verification could not run, state the exact blocker.
- For meaningful code/config changes, update affected docs or explain why none were affected.
